#### Description:

**Tab Whisperer Pro** is a lightweight, personal mindfulness and focus tracker built for people who want just a little peace during their busy day.

When you open the app, it gently greets you with a motivational quote, lets you set a single task to focus on, record your mood, and write a short journal entry ‚Äî all stored locally, without accounts, distractions, or ads.

It's not a productivity monster.  
It's your quiet corner of the internet.
